This is Inhyuk Cho.
This is CPU scheduler for Operating System Term Project of Korea University.
I took the class on First semester of 2018.

The CPU scheduler have 6 algorithms:
1. FCFS(first come first serve)
2. non-preemptive SJF(shortest job first)
3. preemptive SJF
4. non-preemptive priority(lower priority is more important)
5. preemptive priority
6. RR(round robin)

This source is implemented with random process generator and I/O waiting.

All algorithm are implemented by using Heap to sort all process in some order such as priority or arrival time.
